# MemLear
The aim of this study is to check the effect of learning on memory for the items. 

wo conditions will be created: a condition in which participants are going to learn the associations between a character and an object category, and a condition in which particiopants are told what is the contingency. 

The idea is that memory for the items will be improved in the conditions in which participatns are learning, compared to when participants already know the association. 

The two conditions will be interleaved. 

the Contingencies for the unknown condition will be .70 .10 .10 .10. As we needed 40 trials per character, 28 trials for the most probable condition, and 4 each for the least probable ones.
