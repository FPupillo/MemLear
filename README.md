# Prediction and learning

The aim of this study is to check the effect of learning on memory for the items. 

Two conditions will be created: a condition in which participants are going to learn the associations between a character and an object category, and a condition in which particiopants are told what is the contingency. 

The idea is that memory for the items will be improved in the conditions in which participatns are learning, compared to when participants already know the association. 

The two conditions will be interleaved. 

the Contingencies for the unknown condition will be .70 .10 .10 .10. As we needed 40 trials per character, 28 trials for the most probable condition, and 4 each for the least probable ones.

### Practice task
For the practice task, 4 categories were selected : "Gamestoy & entertainment", "Clothing", "Vehicle",  "Food". For each category, 
the first images with the highest category agreement were selected. 

The participants could choose among the four category for each task. To avoid any effect due to the fixed position of the category on the screen, the position of each category changed on each trial. Position and category were permutated to obtained all the possible combinations (4! = 24 for each character). These permutations were repeated two times to obtain 48 trials per character. 40 trials were finally randomly sampled from the 64 trials per character. In total, we had 80 trials. 

2 charachters: red and blues mursk. For the red murks, the food category was the most likely one. 
For the blue character, the gamestoy and entertainment was the most likely one. 

The order of the trials was pseudo-randomised, in order to assure that no more that two consecutive trials would appear in sequence. 

### Main task
For the main task, the four categories that were selected are:  "Outdoor activity & sport item", "Kitchen & utensil","Electronic device & accessory", "Hand labour tool & accessory".

Poisition of the categories in the screen was also permutated as in the practice task. This time, however, the permutations were repeated three times, for a total of 74 trials per characters. Among those 74 trials, 60 trials were randomly selected per carachter. 

2 characters were selected: black and orange murkse. 

taught vs learned categories were counterbalanced across participants
