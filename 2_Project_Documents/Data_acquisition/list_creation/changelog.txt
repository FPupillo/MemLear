1.detected a problem with the the 2.main_task.R: some loops were carried out with the letter "i" instead of "l", resulting with all the lists being basically the same. 
2.created the codebook. 
3. finished the 1st part of the experiment.

2. Pavlovia does not like "image" as a name of a variable. Therefore, I renamed the "image" variable as "img" in the encoding lists

1. Created scripts for analysing the data. Checked the number of images by category in the encoding and recognition list. 
2. Found a mistake in the nBack task- where the PM words were deleted, there were probs for the word as there were hit, but not hit in the list. Fixed

20/12/2021
Discovered a bug<- in the creation list file, a counter named "list" was mistakenly added instead of "l". Created a file to check whether the images at recognition for one list were also displayed at retrieval for the same list. It was shown that this occurred only in list 1 and 2. Therefore, for analysing, exclude the first participants (until tested the 20 of December , 11, 12, 13, 14, 21, 22)

03/01/2022
Analyzing the data - problems with participants 9: only data session 1 but with no data. Deleting that participants from further analyses. 
- some problems with participants 23 - 24- 25- 27

# analyse data recognition - looks fine

# still problems with the nback task. Fixed at the analysis stage.
